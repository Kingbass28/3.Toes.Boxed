      <h3>Brumation:</h3>
        <p>Depending on where you are located, it might get cold during the winter months. Box turtles naturally enter a stage called brumation during the winter, which is a lighter form of hibernation. Brumation happens in many reptiles and it is the act of slowing down the metabolic system to conserve energy. Outdoor owners will generally partake in encouraging there box turtles to enter brumation by burying them underground for several months and digging them back up in the spring. Indoor owners generally will not see their turtle enter brumation.</p>
